											<p>The Golden State Warriors accomplished the goal that they set last July when they signed Kevin Durant by winning the NBA Finals Monday night.</p>
											<p>About two weeks ago, I predicted that the Cavaliers would beat the Warriors in seven games. I wanted this Cavs team to win so badly. I was confident that heroics of Lebron James and Kyrie Irving could catapult this team to another title (no, I’m not a Cavs fan, I just really didn’t want Golden State to win). Needless to say, my prediction was off.</p>
											<h2>Recap</h2>
											<p>The Warriors didn’t just win, they made it look easy. Yes, the last three games of the Finals were much more competitive than the first two, but even in those close games, everyone knew the Warriors could turn their game up another gear and run the Cavs out of the building. As Lebron said, it would have taken an “A++” effort to beat this Warriors team. It also would have taken sub-par effort from the Warriors for the Cavs to win this series. We saw the Warriors play sub-par for much of Game 3 and Game 4, but it didn’t matter when the Cavs played sub-par as well.</p>
											<p>This Warriors team was flat-out better than the Cavs. This was the matchup everyone had been waiting all year for, yet it rarely felt close. The Warriors came within a game of going 16-0 in the postseason. It became entirely reasonable to wonder if the Warriors were the greatest team of all time. There are few teams in NBA history who have been so dangerous on the offensive end, and so tough on the defensive end as well. The outlet passes, the ability to shoot from anywhere on the floor, and the chemistry between star players on this team is incredible. These qualities were showcased beautifully during a 21-2 run by the Warriors in the 2nd quarter of Game 5 where defense led to instant offense. When they played their best basketball, they were unbeatable, and that’s what has led them to a championship.</p>
											<p>Coming into this NBA Finals, there was a ton of pressure on Kevin Durant. His past playoff performances have been somewhat disappointing for, arguably, the second-best player in the world. The narrative of this series had a primary focus on Durant because of his decision to join this all-time-great Warriors team this summer. Based on his past playoff shortcomings, I thought that Durant may under-perform again this year. However, I was dead wrong. Durant became the first player since Shaq to score 30 points in every game of the Finals, and averaged 35.2 PPG for the series. Durant went on to win the Finals MVP award, and finally won his first championship. He was able to shake the playoff demons that have haunted him for much of his career, and gave one of the greatest NBA Finals performances of all time. However, Durant is not the reason that the Warriors won this series.</p>
											<h2>Was It Fair?</h2>
											<p>So much has been made about super-teams throughout this season. To me, there is no question that both of these teams are super teams. However, when comparing the two, the Warriors are more “super”. I think it is fair to say that the if you were to take Lebron off of the Cavs, the Cavs would no longer be a championship-caliber team. However, if you took Kevin Durant off of the Warriors, the Warriors would still be a championship-caliber team. (I am assuming you would trade Durant for some of the rotational players that left after last year.) The Warriors were one win away from another title last year, so I do think that the addition of Durant elevated this team to a level that is far above every other team in the NBA, and the Finals were proof of that.</p>
											<p>For as great as Durant’s performance was, he was not the reason this team won the Finals. He outshined everyone else on the Warriors, but without stellar team defense and ball movement, I’m not so sure that Durant could have carried this team to victory. He deserves all the credit in the world for his performance, but he is not the greatest player in the league right now, and I don’t believe that one championship with this team puts him in an all-time great conversation.</p>
											<p>Many people believe that because of this stacked Warriors team, the NBA is unfair. While the Warriors are head and shoulders above much of the NBA, it is not all their fault. The NBA needs better competition come playoff time. Honestly many teams do not have a competitive roster to battle either the Cavs or the Warriors. What the NBA needs are more competitive teams. This isn’t the first time we’ve see dominance in the NBA.  There have been several dynasties throughout NBA history. The Celtics and Lakers combined won eight championships in the 80’s, the Bulls dominated the 90’s with six championships, and the Lakers and Spurs combined to win seven championships in the 2000’s. This era of basketball has been dominated by the Warriors and Lebron. The difference between this era and previous eras, is that there is less true competition. Jordan’s Bulls always had to get through other elite teams in the Eastern Conference, like the Pistons and Knicks, before they reached the Finals. Larry Bird’s Celtics had several battles with the Pistons in the 80’s before they went on to face the Lakers in the Finals. The Western Conference was loaded with competitive teams in the 2000’s. Between the Lakers, the Spurs, the Suns and Mavericks, it was rarely an easy path to the Finals in the West.</p>
											<p>The NBA is different today. Lebron has not had a true threat in the Eastern Conference since the Celtics had a big three of their own. Although there is more competition in the West, it is different. Although there is more competition in the West, there is no team that presents itself as a true threat in the West. The Rockets are an excellent offensive team, but the Warriors defense would be able to limit this pace in a seven-game series. The Spurs present a threat with Kawhi Leonard playing, but even then, the Spurs are an aging team with an underperforming superstar in Lamarcus Aldridge.</p>
											<p>The NBA needs a shake-up. This is a super-team league, and I’m all for other superstars teaming up across the league. I’d like to see how other super-teams compete with the Warriors and Cavs. Even if they don’t eventually beat either of these teams, it would be nice to see competitive playoff series other than the NBA Finals, and teams with a chance of ending this Warriors-Cavs streak.</p>
											<h2>What's Next?</h2>
											<p>Even if the end of this season was a bit disappointing, the NBA is still rich with great stories. The NBA Draft is coming up on June 22. Not only is this one of the deepest and most talented drafts that the NBA has seen in recent years, but there is also great opportunity for trades. Will the Celtics finally give up that No. 1 overall pick for Jimmy Butler or Paul George? Will the Lakers make a move for Paul George?</p>
											<p>Let’s not forget the center of attention on draft night... Lavar Ball! The world will be waiting to see what outrageous statement he makes next. In all seriousness, though, his son Lonzo could be drafted by the Lakers and give the NBA an incredibly great marketing situation. The Lakers could once again be relevant, and have a popular, talented player as the face of the franchise.</p>
											<p>This summer’s free agency class will also be interesting to watch. Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant will be free agents, and both are expected to stay in Golden State. It will be interesting to see how much they will both be paid, considering how much this team has to spend on payroll. Blake Griffin will be a free agent, and there have been rumors of him swapping teams in the past, so anything is possible here. Another big name to watch is Gordon Hayward. It almost seems inevitable that he will be playing elsewhere next season, with rumors of him being pursued heavily by both Boston and Miami. If Boston were somehow able to sign him and trade for Butler, suddenly the Eastern Conference is much more competitive. </p>
											<p>For now, the Warriors are champs, and on the cusp of a dynasty. This league has been filled with dynasties in past eras, and this Warriors team may just be the newest one to join the list.</p>
