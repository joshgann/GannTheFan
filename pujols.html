											<p>Albert Pujols has been regarded as one of the greatest to ever play baseball throughout his career, but it seems that we’ve forgotten about his greatness.</p>
											<p>On June 3, Albert Pujols became the ninth player to hit 600 home runs. This is a huge milestone, and now puts him just 163 homers shy of the record for career home runs. However, it seems like it was hardly noticed. Sure, this has happened before, especially in recent years. The NBA Finals and Stanley Cup Finals are also in full gear, which definitely take some of the attention away from baseball, but this is a big deal. Pujols even hit a grand slam for number 600; that’s the first time that’s ever happened. Yet, it still didn’t attract the attention it deserved.</p>
											<p>I’m a Cubs fan, so watching baseball growing up I saw a lot of Pujols. I always knew he was great when he played for St. Louis, but I didn’t realize how great he was. In his first 10 seasons in St. Louis, he posted at least a .300 batting average, 30 home runs, and 100 RBIs. One other crazy stat that stood out to me is that he has never once struck out 100 times in a season. He was putting up MVP-worthy numbers almost every season. He was the best player in baseball during his years in St. Louis, and it was almost given that he would one day be a first-ballot hall of famer. He was king of baseball, and it’s easy to see why. He wasn’t just the best player in baseball, but he was also on one of the best teams in baseball. He won two championships with the Cardinals, and was a major reason why the Cardinals won those two championships. </p>
											<p>It’s hard to imagine being in a better spot than Pujols was in at that time in his career. After eleven full seasons with the Cardinals, he had brought in three MVPs, two championships and six silver slugger awards, not to mention the several other accolades he racked up. Eleven seasons brought him to the latter end of the prime of his career and entering free agency, when he signed a contract that shook the entire sports community. The 10-year $240 million deal that sent him to the Angels not only shifted the league, but also allowed everyone to ponder just how much Pujols could do in his career. Would he win several more rings? Would he shatter Barry Bond’s home run record? Maybe a triple crown?</p>
											<p>Six years later, some may be wondering what could have been for Pujols. His years in Los Angeles have not been utterly disappointing, but he has not been who he was in St. Louis. The Angels have been one of the biggest disappointments in baseball over these six years. They have made the playoffs once since the arrival of Pujols, and presented one of the most talented and expensive rosters early in Pujols stint with the Angels. On a team where Pujols was not the best player on the team, that’s an extreme disappointment. As for Pujols, should anyone be that surprised that his production dropped off?</p>
											<p>When you hit 40 plus home runs six times in eleven years, people expect crazy things. The ceiling was ridiculously high for Pujols when he went to Los Angeles. It may have been a little too high. It’s unheard of to have the type of seasons that Pujols had in St. Louis, so why was the expectation for him to continue with that kind of production? A player moving towards the end of his prime should tell that maybe the best has already happened. I’ve already mentioned how much this team has underperformed, but another reason for Pujols’s drop-off in production has been his susceptibility to injury. Pujols had been sidelined for extended periods of time due to injury before, but he has also played through injuries during his stint with the Angels. According to an article by Alden Gonzalez for <a href="http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/19509705/albert-pujols-los-angeles-angels-chases-600th-homer-amid-many-empty-seats">ESPN</a>, Pujols’s coach, Mike Scioscia, testifies to Pujols playing through injury. “He does not want to be out of the lineup,” said Scioscia. According to an article by Bob Nightengale for <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2017/06/04/albert-pujols-600-home-runs-future-home-run-record/102490006/">USA Today</a>, Scioscia called Pujols the “toughest ballplayer I’ve ever seen,” and stated that much of the time, Pujols is playing at 50% of himself because of injury.</p>
											<p>There’s no doubt that an injured Albert Pujols is not the same record-setting player that he once was. However, there is still a chance we see Pujols pull off the greatest feat in baseball history. Yes, I’m talking about breaking Barry Bonds’s career record of 762 home runs. I know, it sounds unimaginable considering his level of play is not the same as it once was. However, Pujols is 37 years old. He has four seasons left under contract with the Angels, and he has hit 80 home runs since 2015. That’s very good for a guy his age, dealing with injures. If Pujols continues to post the kinds of numbers he has over the last two seasons, he could possibly reach 700 home runs by the age of 40 or 41. If he’s able to do that, then why not reach 763? The only thing in between Pujols and the record is injury. Father Time is undefeated they say, but I don’t see Pujols’s career being over by the age of 40.</p>
											<p>Even if he doesn’t break the record, he is still a first-ballot hall of famer. Pujols has quite honestly become forgettable in the world of baseball since joining the Angels, but the 600 milestone is a reminder that he is still one of the greatest to ever play the game. Wouldn’t it be something if the all-time home run leader was steroid free? Pujols still has a shot at making that happen.</p>
