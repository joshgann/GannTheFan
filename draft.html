											<p>Last Thursday, the future of several NBA franchises shifted during the NBA draft, as one of the most talented draft classes in recent memory entered the league.</p>
											<p>Just a couple of weeks ago, the NBA was under scrutiny for a lackluster NBA Finals and an unfair level of play. However, the past week has given hope to fans everywhere and almost redeemed a forgettable NBA season. With trade rumors of some of the game’s biggest stars swirling around, the feeling on draft night was that a big trade would finally be made. Not only were trade expectations high, but the expectations of this draft class were also high. Lonzo Ball hasn’t played a game in the league yet, but he has already gained more fame than some current NBA stars. And yes, his father Lavar showed up and made his presence known, drawing heavy boos from the Brooklyn crowd. </p>
											<p>Although players like Paul George and Kristaps Porzingis weren’t traded amid trade rumors, one big name was swapped, and that was Jimmy Butler. The Minnesota Timberwolves stole the show on draft night by trading Kris Dunn, Zach Lavine, and the No. 7 overall pick to the Chicago Bulls for Jimmy Butler. I will get into the positives and negatives of this deal later, but this trade is good for the NBA. It opens the door for more superstars to be moved. If Minnesota is ready to move into a “win-now” phase, other teams may react to this trade by trying to assemble multiple superstars themselves.</p>
											<p>There were also several noteworthy draft selections that will set the course for the future of the NBA. Let’s look at the winners and losers of this draft.</p>
											<h2>Winners</h2>
											<h3>Philadelphia 76ers</h3>
											<p>The Philadelphia 76ers took a gamble by trading the No. 3 pick in this year’s draft, and either the 2018 Lakers’ first-round pick or the Kings’ 2019 first-round pick for the No. 1 overall pick just days before the draft. The 76ers have a pretty solid core of young players already, with two Rookie-of-the-Year candidates in Joel Embiid and Dario Saric. Embiid looks like he could be the best center in the league in a couple of years, and Dario Saric shows great potential as well. Last year’s No.1 overall pick Ben Simmons also looks very promising. Embiid gives the Sixers great post scoring and defense, and Simmons will hopefully give great passing from the wing. If there was one thing the Sixers were missing, it was a flat-out scorer from the perimeter, which is exactly what they got in Markelle Fultz in this year’s draft. Fultz averaged 23 PPG in college, and showcased a repertoire of promising offensive skills. There were questions about his leadership ability coming out of Washington, as he only won 9 games over his one season in college. However, this record shouldn’t matter as he accompanies this exciting, young Sixers team. Accompanying his scoring at either guard position with the talent already in Philly should be enough to make this team a real contender in years to come.</p>
											<h3>Los Angeles Lakers</h3>
											<p>It has been a long time since the Lakers have experienced a drought like the one they’re currently in. The last time they made the playoffs was 2013. Since then, they have been racking up top-ten draft picks. Players like D’Angello Russell, Julius Randle and Brandon Ingram have built a strong core of young players for head coach Luke Walton. Everyone and their mother had expected this team to select Lonzo Ball in this year’s draft, and that the Lakers did. Many wondered how this would work with D’Angelo Russell already playing point guard. Those questions were answered with the Lakers’ trade of Russell to Brooklyn for Brook Lopez. This will give Lonzo Ball the freedom to operate as the Lakers’ starting point guard, which should excite Lakers’ fans everywhere. Ball has great potential. His athleticism may not be as great as other guards in this draft, but his leadership, court vision, passing and three-point shooting is exceptional. If the Lakers can keep his father from trying to coach the team himself, good things will come their way. The D’Angelo Russell trade is also positive because it clears up cap space for next summer’s free agent class. Bringing in Brook Lopez is smart because his contract is expiring, and the Lakers will likely let him go in free agency in pursuit of signing Paul George and Lebron James. The Lakers have made themselves an attractive destination again with budding stars like Lonzo Ball and front-office legacy like Magic Johnson.</p>
											<h3>Sacramento Kings</h3>
											<p>Before this draft, I didn’t even think of the Kings as a possible winner of this draft. However, they may just be the biggest winner of this draft. This organization was coming off the heels of a highly questionable trade that sent their franchise centerpiece, Demarcus Cousins, to New Orleans for far less than he was worth. I believed it was time for this team to rebuild, but the way they started this rebuild looked very discouraging for Kings’ fans. Yet, the Kings pulled off a fantastic draft. They entered the draft with the No. 5 overall pick and the No. 10 overall pick, but ended up swapping the No. 10 for the No. 15 and 20 overall picks. The Kings left the Draft with De’Aaron Fox, Justin Jackson, Harry Giles, and Frank Mason. The wealth of future talent here is the best that any team collected on draft night. Fox will finally give the kings stability at the point guard position. His strong defense and his quickness will make him electric at the next level, and after owning Lonzo Ball in the NCAA Tournament, some believe he may be the best point guard in this draft class. The Kings also picked up Justin Jackson, who is coming off of a great season at North Carolina, where he won the National Championship. He will look to contribute immediately to this Kings team. The selection of Harry Giles is also impressive because of the potential there. Giles has been riddled with injury in his young basketball career, but before the college season started he was considered the second-best prospect in this freshman class of players. His stock has fallen since then, but if he can stay healthy, there is hope that he could be a future star in this league. The Kings haven’t seen this much potential in a long time, and the playoffs are closer than some may think for this team.</p>
											<h3>Honorable Mention</h3>
											<p>I really like Malik Monk, and the fact that he fell all the way to No. 11 overall in this draft was crazy to me. Had the 76ers had stayed with the No. 3 pick in this draft, I thought they would be smart to take Monk at No. 3 overall. The fact that the Hornets were able to snatch him at 11 is awesome for the Hornets. Adding him alongside Kemba Walker will make for a dynamic backcourt in Charlotte.</p>
											<h2>Losers</h2>
											<h3>Boston Celtics</h3>
											<p>Danny Ainge stuck to his normal script on draft night when he drafted Jayson Tatum with the No. 3 overall pick. The Celtics are coming off the heels of an Eastern Conference Finals appearance in which they were dismantled by the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Celtics are clearly working on a timeline that expects that they will be great when Lebron James is no longer a force in the Eastern Conference. However, they are assuming that the young prospects that they have already drafted are going to be future all-stars, and that there won’t be other great teams in the Eastern Conference. The Celtics have good players in their prime like Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley. However, they are putting their stock in players like Jaylen Brown, Marcus Smart, and now Jayson Tatum. While all of these players have potential, I’m not sure that any of them will become as great of a player as Isaiah Thomas is now, and we see that a team led by Isaiah Thomas now isn’t a true contender. With the Cavs struggling to make moves to keep Lebron in Cleveland, the Cavs may be out of contention sooner than the Celtics thought. The Celtics window to win may actually be now. The Celtics are already loaded at the small forward position, with Jae Crowder and Jaylen Brown, so the Jayson Tatum pick just complicates things further. The Celtics would have been smart to make a trade for either Jimmy Butler or Paul George, but unfortunately for them that didn’t happen. The Celtics’ stubbornness towards trading young assets for a current all-star may finally come back to haunt them.</p>
											<h3>Indiana Pacers</h3>
											<p>I get what the Pacers are trying to do here. Paul George had more trade rumors swirling around him than any other player coming into draft night. The expectation was for him to be traded, but he was not traded, and remains on the Indiana Pacers. The Pacers know that George wants to sign with the Lakers next summer, and they want to be wowed by an offer in order to trade George. It makes sense, because the Pacers should get a lot in return for Paul George. However, other teams realize that George wants to be in L.A. first and foremost. If those teams don’t believe that they could build a team that George would want to sign with long-term, then they will be less willing to trade for him. There are few teams in the league that could convince George to stay with them long-term. Therefore, the trade offers that the Pacers want may start to dwindle down. The league has seen two stars, Jimmy Butler and Demarcus Cousins, traded for far less than what they are worth over the past few months, because teams aren’t willing to give away a massive amount for these star players. The Pacers eventually may need to settle for less if they want to get anything in return for Paul George, and that’s why I think they should have traded him on draft night. The closer the Pacers get to next summer’s free agency season, the closer they get to letting Paul George walk for nothing.</p>
											<h2>Timberwolves-Bulls Trade</h2>
											<p>First things first, the Timberwolves won this trade. This was an incredible move to pull off, and it makes the Timberwolves an elite team on the rise in the Western Conference. This new core of Butler, Towns and Wiggins is one of the best young cores in the league, and they didn’t give up much at all for it. I wanted to discuss this trade separately from the winners and losers of draft night, but the Timberwolves were a huge winner on draft night.</p>
											<p> On the opposite end of this trade, the Bulls are seen by many as a huge loser from this trade. However, I don’t find that to be true. Yes, they could and should have gotten a lot more for Butler. The problem was that no one was willing to give them more than what they got from Minnesota. The Celtics had plenty of assets to make a trade for Butler, but they were intent on keeping those assets. The Cavaliers could have involved a third team in a trade for Butler, but all they had to give was Kevin Love, who reportedly didn’t draw much interest, per <a href="http://uproxx.com/dimemag/cavs-jimmy-butler-paul-george-trade-rumors-kevin-love/">Uproxx</a>. The Bulls were in desperate need of a rebuild, and needed to deal Butler sooner rather than later. He had been in the trade market for almost a year, and nothing too impressive surfaced in a trade offer. I believe this deal was necessary for the Bulls to finally restart as an organization. Although the assets they got in return aren’t very impressive, I believe there is still some potential with some of them. I’m not sold on Lavine, because he is coming off of a torn ACL injury, and has never produced more than great athleticism on the court. However, Kris Dunn shows great defensive skills. Although the rest of his game was very disappointing in his rookie season, there is still reason to hope. A lot of his struggles come from not getting enough play time, so hopefully with more play time, he can emerge as a top point guard in this league. The Bulls selected Lauri Markkanen with the No. 7 overall pick they got from Minnesota, and while some feel this was a reach, I believe it is a solid pick. He showcases a lot of offense, and he may be the best shooter in this draft. Although he still has a lot of work to do to become a more complete player, his potential is very high. I see Markkanen’s floor as being a Ryan Anderson-type-player, and his ceiling as being a Kristaps Porzingis-type-player.</p>
