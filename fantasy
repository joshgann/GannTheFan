											<p>It’s that time of year again. NFL training camps are officially underway, and with that comes the beginning of the fantasy football season. While some are soaking in every last minute of summer on the beach, there are those taking mock drafts, reading scouting reports, and doing anything else possible to prepare themselves for their upcoming fantasy drafts.</p>
											<p>This is the prime time for league’s around the country to be drafting, so with that in mind, I am here to give you the right approach to your fantasy draft. </p>
											<p>The league that I am in has already drafted, and saw running backs steal the show at the top of the draft. Le’veon Bell went first, David Johnson was drafted second, and Ezekiel Elliot was drafted third (before the suspension).  After the draft, I asked members of my league who they thought were the biggest sleepers and disappointments in this year’s draft. This blog features Oliver Burke, Cody Carlson and Grant Melvin from my league, and I will address their answers below. </p>
											<h2>Quarterbacks</h2>
											<span class="image object">
												<img src="http://offtherecordsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/PhilipRivers.jpg" height="20" width="20"/>
											</span>
											<h3>Sleepers</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Carson Palmer, Philip Rivers</li>
												<li>Cody: Philip Rivers</li>
												<li>Grant: Eli Manning</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Philip Rivers gets two votes in this section, and it should be no surprise. Rivers finished as the No. 6 overall fantasy quarterback last season, and threw the second-most touchdown passes of his career with 33 touchdowns. Rivers may not be the most enticing option at quarterback at 35 years old, but he is a consistent option. He has thrown over 4,200 yards in each of his last 4 seasons, and thrives year after year in this offense. </p>
											<p>Carson Palmer is returning after considering retirement this offseason, and while coming off of a somewhat disappointing season, he still shows upside. He passed for over 4,200 yards and 26 touchdowns last season, and still quarterbacks an offense that likes to air the ball out. Eli Manning comes into the 2017 season with one of the best receiving corps in football. He’s coming off of a disappointing season, but with the talent surrounding him, he could be a top 5 fantasy quarterback this season.</p>
											<h3>Players to Avoid</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Ben Roethlisberger</li>
												<li>Cody: Ben Roethlisberger</li>
												<li>Grant: Andrew Luck</li>
											</ul>
											<p>It’s important to be careful when drafting quarterbacks. You don’t want to reach on a quarterback too early in a draft, and you don’t want to draft someone with injury tendencies. Injury issues are the fault with the quarterbacks in this list. Ben Roethlisberger has arguably the biggest arsenal of offensive weapons in the league, but he is extremely prone to injury. Although he has never missed more than four games in a season, he is nearing the end of his career, and one more significant injury could potentially end his career. Another issue with Big Ben is his inability to perform up to par on the road. </p>
											<p>Luck presents the same problem with injury. He can easily be a top 5 fantasy quarterback option when he is healthy, but he is entering the season on the PUP list. He is coming off of a shoulder surgery that was successful, so it will be important to keep that in mind when drafting.</p>
											<h2>Running Backs</h2>
											<span class="image object">

											<h3>Sleepers</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Dalvin Cook, Joe Mixon</li>
												<li>Cody: Carlos Hyde</li>
												<li>Grant: Ameer Abdullah</li>
											</ul>
											<p>This year’s rookie class of running backs is loaded with talent, but Dalvin Cook and Joe Mixon have somewhat flown under the radar. While Leonard Fournette and Christian McCaffrey may steal attention of drafters, Cook and Mixon offer just as much upside. Cook has been turning heads in Minnesota, as he is expected to be the starter come Week 1. Mixon will likely lead the Bengals’ in touches, whether he opens Week 1 as the starter or not. Both of these backs can attack defenses rushing the football and receiving, which adds to their fantasy value.</p>
											<p>Carlos Hyde may not be recognized as a top-tier fantasy back, but in an offense where he is the biggest playmaker, he could shine. If he can repeat the success that he had last season with nearly 1,000 rushing yards, he could stand out. Ameer Abdullah has been injury prone in each of his two seasons in the league, if he can stay healthy he could lead the charge for the Lions’ rushing attack. </p>
											<h3>Players to Avoid</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Lagarrette Clount</li>
												<li>Cody: Marshawn Lynch</li>
												<li>Grant: MArshawn Lynch</li>
											</ul>
											<p>It’s hard not to love Marshawn Lynch. He has come out of retirement to play for his hometown team, and with the intensity this guy plays with, it’s hard to imagine him not succeeding. Unfortunately, Lynch is coming off of a year away from football and is already old in football age. There are young backs behind Lynch on the depth chart who could take playing time away from him if he struggles. It will be difficult for Lynch to overcome Father Time this year. </p>
											<p>The Eagles are used to using smaller, quicker running backs, and Lagarrette Blount will lead as the starter for this team, and look to run between the tackles as a more physical back. This is a new element to the Eagles’ offense, and he may struggle with the scheme this offense is used to running.</p>
											<h2>Wide Receivers</h2>
											<span class="image object">
												<img src="http://www.billboard.com/files/media/jarvis-landry-2015-billboard-embed.jpg" height="20" width="20"/>
											</span>
											<h3>Sleepers</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Keenan Allen, Martavis Bryant</li>
												<li>Cody: Jarvis Landry</li>
												<li>Grant: Rishard Matthews</li>
											</ul>
											<p>The wide receiver position is arguably the deepest position in fantasy football. However, there are some hidden gems deeper in the crop of receivers in this league. Keenan Allen went out with an ACL injury last season, but will return as the No. 1 receiver this year. He is a sleeper because even if the Chargers are an underwhelming team, their passing attack is consistently strong, and Allen has been putting up big numbers since his rookie season. Martavis Bryant is facing a suspension, but if he is reinstated early in the season, he could be very good. He has scored 14 touchdowns in 21 career games and shows tremendous upside. Antonio Brown may draw double teams, which would likely leave Bryant open more often than not.</p>
											<p>Jarvis Landry is coming off of a standout season in which he scored 120 fantasy points. It may be difficult for Landry to receive as many targets with Jay Cutler at quarterback and not Ryan Tannehill, but fantasy owners should still see lots of potential in Landry. He won’t be anyone’s WR1, but he still could easily rack in 1,000 yards with a veteran QB in a familiar offensive system. Rishard Matthews is part of a young bunch of receivers in Tennessee. He may not be a starter on your team, but he could serve greatly coming off of the bench or as a flex. With quarterback Marcus Mariota poised for a breakout year, we could see Matthews benefit with targets and touchdowns.</p>
											<h3>Players to Avoid</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Brandin Cooks</li>
												<li>Cody: Larry Fitzgerald</li>
												<li>Grant: Tyreek Hill</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Brandin Cooks’s chances of winning a title significantly increased when he was traded to the Patriots this offseason. However, the same can’t be said for his fantasy value. Cooks is joining an offense with weapons like Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman. Then there’s the fact that quarterback Tom Brady uses a plethora of receivers and backs, and runs a complex offense. Cooks specializes in the deep ball, and it’s hard to imagine Cooks producing the big numbers he did last season in this crowded offense.</p>
											<p>Larry Fitzgerald is nearing the end of his career, and his production started to fade away towards the end of last season. Fitzgerald’s name alone carries lots of respect, but while some may still see him as a WR1, he is more like a WR3 in standard leagues. Fitzgerald may see the younger receivers on this Cardinals’ roster take away some of his targets. Tyreek Hill showed lots of potential last season, but it’s hard to see him repeating so much success. Travis Kelce will still be the main target for Alex Smith, and it’s possible Hill enters a sophomore slump, as he may see more double teams this season.</p>
											<h2>Tight Ends</h2>
											<span class="image object">
												<img src="https://s3media.247sports.com/Uploads/Assets/260/318/6_7318260.jpg" height="20" width="20"/>
											</span>
											<h3>Sleepers</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Antonio Gates</li>
												<li>Cody: Kyle Rudolph</li>
												<li>Grant: O.J. Howard</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Kyle Rudolph has quietly become one of the better fantasy football tight ends. Quarterback Sam Bradford loves throwing to him in the red zone, so he has the chance to rack in a lot of touchdowns. He may not be a top-tier tight end, but he could be a steal if he slides to later rounds. His ability to score elevates his status.</p>
											<p>Antonio Gates may take the backseat to Hunter Henry this year, but he consistently puts up big fantasy numbers, and is still a big red zone threat for Philip Rivers. O.J. Howard shouldn’t be a high draft pick considering he is a rookie in a crowded offense. However, he could be a steal because he could prove to score a lot of touchdowns and be a big red zone threat.</p>
											<h3>Players to Avoid</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Oliver: Jordan Reed</li>
												<li>Cody: Rob Gronkowski</li>
												<li>Grant: Jordan Reed</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Jordan Reed scares a lot of fantasy owners, and it’s not surprising why. Reed is entering the season with a lingering foot issue and is on the PUP list. Reed has never played a full 16 games in a season, and he missed four games last season. It would be very risky to take him as your No. 1 TE, and over other tight ends like Jimmy Graham, Greg Olsen and Travis Kelce.</p>
											<p>I’m not saying not to pick Rob Gronowski. He was picked in the first round in our draft, and when he is healthy he is by far the best TE in the league. However, you are drafting at your own risk when drafting Gronk. He hasn’t played a full 16 games since 2011, and when he does get hurt, he tends to miss a lot of time. He is a high risk, high reward type of player.</p>
											<p>A fantasy football season is full of ups and downs, so it’s important to draft a solid, consistent team. It’s been a long summer, but the thrill of draft season is finally here. Good luck.</p>
