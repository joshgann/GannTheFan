											<h1>Aaron Judge is Taking Over Baseball</h1>

											<p>Aaron Judge has taken the MLB by storm this season with his electrifying play at the plate while playing for the most popular team in the sport, the New York Yankees.</p>
											<p>Judge leads the league in almost every major-offensive-statistical category, and has quickly become one of the league’s biggest stars. He boosted this sudden rise to fame Monday night during the Home Run Derby that he won in commanding fashion. Judge captivated the Miami crowd with four home runs that each traveled over 500 feet. This performance solidified his standing as one of the league’s best hitters, and a rising star in a sport that is in desperate need of big names.</p>
											<p>One of the most noticeable things about Judge is his incredible athleticism. Judge stands 6-foot-7-inches tall, and weighs 282 lbs. He looks like an NFL tight end or an NBA all-star forward. His power at the plate adds to his impressive build, as he absolutely crushes pitches that get left hanging over the heart of the plate. He drew comparisons to Lebron James this week because of his unique strength and height. Some think Judge can dominate baseball with his athleticism the way James has dominated the NBA with his unique build for the last several years. These are high praises for a rookie, but his numbers this season are extremely worthy of this praise. </p>
											<p>IAt around the halfway point of the season, Judge has posted 30 home runs, 66 RBI’s, a .329 batting average, and a 1.139 OPS (On-Base Plus Slugging Percentage). His 30 home runs have already broken the Yankee’s all-time single-season record for most home runs by a rookie, and he leads the entire MLB in home runs thus far. His OPS and WAR (Wins Above Replacement) also lead the MLB. It’s fair to say that Judge is having an MVP-caliber season, and is fueling the Yankee’s success.</p>
											<p>Judge’s success was not only unpredictable, but it’s also unheard of. With these kinds of numbers, many are wondering just how great he can be in this league.</p>
											<h2>The Growth</h2>
											<p>Although this is Judge’s rookie season, he played 27 games in the 2016 season. He showed potential in those games, but also showed some issues. He struck out on nearly half of his at-bats in those 27 games. Strikeouts are a common theme among young hitters, but his strike-out rate was very alarming. This season, he has brought his strikeout rate down to a much lower 36 percent. This huge drop shows a quick maturation to his plate approach. Another sign of this improved approach is his increased number of walks. He was only walked nine times in 2016, but has drawn 61 walks this season.</p>
											<p>One of Judge’s more impressive stats is his batting average on balls in play. This statistic measures how many balls hit in the field of play are hits for a batter, and does not include home runs. Considering Judge is a power hitter and leads the league in home runs, the fact that he leads the league in this statistic is mind-blowing. This further proves Judge’s development into a consistent hitter. He is not just a guy who is going to hit a lot of home runs, he is also one who can tactically put the ball in play to drive in runs or advance runners on base. His batting average on balls in play is nearly double what it was last year, which once again proves his maturity at the plate</p>
											<h2>The Downside</h2>
											<p>Judge isn’t just having a breakout season, he’s having a historic season. It’s rare that we ever see a player dominate the major-offensive-statistical categories like Judge is, let alone a rookie. Judge could be in contention for the triple crown if he keeps pace with the first half of the season. He’s currently 1st in home runs, 2nd in RBI’s 3rd in batting average in the AL. The biggest concern for Judge is keeping pace with this tremendous start. Baseball is a game of ups and downs. Hitters can get hot for extended periods of time, but then become ice cold at the plate in a few number of at bats. Baseball hasn’t seen someone with this much success this early in their career before. It will be extremely difficult for Judge to keep pace this season, let alone the rest of his career. Sooner or later, pitchers are going to find the pitches that Judge struggles with. He’s been nearly perfect thus far, but that does not mean he will always be this “perfect”.</p>
											<p>One thing people may not realize about Judge is that it is also unprecedented for a hitter this tall to have so much success. Tall batters have larger strike zones, and give pitchers more room to work with when facing these batters. Judge has been making pitchers across the league pay for pitching in the heart of the plate or towards the top of the strike zone. However, when pitchers start zoning in on the bottom of the strike zone, we may see Judge struggle more. It is difficult for someone at his height to cover so much space with the bat, and pitchers may start aiming lower to expose a possible weakness.</p>
											<h2>The Upside</h2>
											Judge is carrying the New York Yankees. That’s not to say that this team would be worthless without him, because there are other great, young hitters on this team also. However, no one has the potential that Judge has. He makes this Yankees team better than it would be without him, and that is impressive for a position player. There are few hitters who can mean as much to a team as Judge does to the Yankees. He is the current and future face of this franchise, and can make them great for years to come. He must remain the consistent hitter that he is. The good news for Judge is that he has shown more than just an extremely great ability to hit home runs. He gets on base frequently, and can hit the ball from foul pole to foul pole. Teams can’t really pull a defensive shift on him because he can put the ball just about anywhere on the field.</p>
											<p>I seriously doubt that Judge can continue this kind of production throughout his career, but he can certainly produce 75 percent of this. Even half of this production would be solid for him. However, there are loads of athleticism and potential in this guy, and he is very young. We could be looking at the next Mike Trout, and the future face of this sport. There will be a lot of pressure on this guy, especially playing in New York, but he could be the best player in this league in a few years.</p>
											<p>Whether he wins MVP, Rookie of the Year or the Triple Crown this year, we will likely be hearing Judge’s name for years to come.</p>
