											<h1>Third Times the Charm</h1>
										</header>
										<p>On Thursday June 1, the Cleveland Cavaliers will face the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals for the third straight year. Never before have any two teams met in the finals for three consecutive years. Many will say that the Cavs and Warriors have become the NBA’s premiere rivalry, while others, such as Lebron James, refuse to classify these two teams as rivals. This year’s NBA playoffs have been regarded by many as lackluster. The Cavs and Warriors have a combined 2017 playoff record of 24-1. As shocking as the record is, we should all have seen this rematch coming.</p>
										<p>When Kevin Durant signed with the Warriors last July, he practically ordained another Cavs-Warriors Finals rematch. How could a team that set the NBA regular season record for wins the year before not reach the Finals again after adding a former MVP? On the other side of the NBA, Lebron James held a six-year streak of reaching the Finals, and just like years past, there was not a proven contender in the Eastern Conference that seemed capable of taking James and the Cavs down. The regular season gave us the heroics of Russell Westbrook, James Harden, and Kawhi Leonard, while the playoffs gave us all Cavs and Warriors. Now that we are back to our regularly scheduled program of a Cavs-Warriors Final, it seems like we as fans deserve another great Finals. As I preview this matchup, there are several stories to follow.</p>
										<h2>Kevin Durant's Legacy</h2>
										<p>I think I have heard the most about what this series means to Kevin Durant in anticipation of these Finals. Durant has been viewed as the primary villain of the NBA this season, similar to how Lebron was viewed in his first year in Miami. Fans have too easily put the blame on Durant for the league’s lack of parity. When asked about this notion, Durant replied, “I can’t play for every team, so the truth of the matter is I left one team. It’s one more team that you probably would’ve thought would’ve been a contender. One more team. I couldn’t have made the (entire) East better. I couldn’t have made everybody (else) in the West better,” according to <a href="http://hoopshype.com/2017/05/26/kevin-durant-nets-celtics-nba-quotes/">HoopsHype</a><p>
											<p>Durant has a good point here. There are several teams who have done a poor job of building around a superstar, or at least putting a competitive team on the floor. However, Durant is still a major reason for this lack of parity. The Warriors were great last year, 73-9 great. Yet, they weren’t 12-0 in the playoffs great. Sure, the Western Conference is weaker, and the Warriors didn’t match up with any team nearly as good as last year’s Thunder in this year’s playoffs. However, there is no debating that this Warriors team is the best team in the NBA, and even better than last year’s record-setting team. No team has ever swept their conference before this year’s Warriors. That’s impressive, and should not be overlooked.<p>
												<p>With that being said, none of that matters if they lose to the Cavs. None of it matters for Durant either. Not personally for Durant, but for the NBA fan base. There is so much at stake here for Durant. If he loses, the world instantly takes aim and absolutely annihilates Durant for not winning with one of the greatest teams ever constructed. You will get to watch Stephen A. Smith yelling at the top of his lungs on an endless loop on ESPN for several days. It would be catastrophic for Durant. However, if he wins, is it that impressive?</p>
												<p>The only way I see Durant coming out of these Finals victorious, is if he is the reason the Warriors defeat the Cavs. It must be about him and only him. He can’t rely on Steph, Draymond, or any sort of injury to any major Cavs superstar. He must will this team to win over a full-strength Cavs team. </p>
												<h2>Lebron's Legacy</h2>
												<p>You know Lebron James is in another NBA Finals if the Jordan-Lebron comparisons start surfacing again. At this point in Lebron James’s career, there’s not much to prove. The only thing he is concerned with is six rings. That’s the magic number. While this is extreme motivation for him, it doesn’t matter to me. He has three rings, he ended the championship drought in Cleveland, and his statistical rankings all-time are phenomenal.</p>
											<p>So what if he loses? Sure that would bring his Finals record down to 3-5, but even with that record, he’s the player most compared to Michael Jordan. We all know Lebron is one of the greatest to ever play, and some say he is the greatest. He doesn’t need a win in this year’s Finals to validate anything. No one is going to say he is better than Jordan with four rings. They’re going to say he needs six, and even then, that may not be enough. Sure, it gets him closer to Jordan in some people’s minds, but he doesn’t need this championship. </p>
											<p>We already recognize him as one of the best, and he is going up against arguably the most star-studded roster ever. It’s easily forgivable if he cannot defend the Cleveland Cavaliers title this year against the Warriors. However, if he wins against this team, it elevates his legacy. I’ve said countless times how good this Warriors team is, and no matter how they beat them, if the Cavs beat them, Lebron is a hero (isn’t it funny how the tables have turned?). He’s a hero, and the Jordan-lovers suddenly shake in their boots because of how close Lebron is to Jordan.</p>
											<p>Lebron is the best player in the world, and he’s hungry. Watch out Warriors.</p>
											<h2>Steph vs. Kyrie</h2>
											<p>No one is making this a rivalry, and I’m not saying it is, but pay close attention to this matchup. Two years ago, Kyrie was injured when Steph Curry and the Warriors defeated the Cavs. Last year, Kyrie was brilliant, and his great play was a huge factory in the Cavs title. I imagine there were points this offseason and/or season when Steph woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat from a nightmare. That nightmare was Kyrie draining that clutch three over Steph in Game 7 of last year’s finals.</p>
											<p>Steph, it’s your turn. Both of these players need to perform well in order for their team to win; they are each far too important to their respective teams. Even if Steph isn’t guarding Kyrie most of the series, he’s got to be electric on the offensive end. We haven’t truly seen Steph dominate in a Finals yet, and maybe this will be the one. However, Kyrie has proved that he is clutch in the past. If this series lives up to its hype, and is a close six-seven game series, I believe Kyrie once again wins this matchup.</p>
											<h2>My Prediction</h2>
												<p>There are some people calling for a Warriors sweep of the Cavs. Kevin Love doesn’t think the Cavs should be such an underdog, and I don’t either. Lebron won’t get swept at this stage of his career. There is a lot on the line for Kevin Durant, and he knows that. However, I’m not that confident in him being the hero for the Warriors. I also think Kyrie Irving has more special performances in store. With these things being said, I predict that the Cavs will win in seven games.</p>
