											<p>Just when the NBA offseason seemed to be winding down, Kyrie Irving reheated the hot stove last week with more trade rumors.</p>
											<p>Irving is an NBA champion, and has played his part in a duo with Lebron James in Cleveland for the past three years. The two have had a near flawless connection on the court, and Irving’s game has grown tremendously throughout the three seasons together. Most will recognize Irving for his heroics late in game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals. </p>
											<p>The NBA has seen more movement of big-name stars this summer than just about any offseason in years past. However, it still came as a complete surprise when news surfaced of Kyrie Irving wanting to be traded. Irving has become a top-ten player in the league since Lebron James returned to Cleveland, and has made the Finals with the Cavaliers in three consecutive seasons. Some wonder what on Earth would cause Irving to want to be traded, while some see this as the perfect time to demand a trade. </p>
											<h2>Why Should Kyrie Want to Stay?</h2>
											<p>Damian Lillard voiced the thoughts that most NBA fans were thinking when the Irving drama was announced by saying, “I mean, who wouldn’t want to go to the Finals every year?” (per<a href="https://www.blazersedge.com/2017/7/24/16022242/kyrie-irving-trade-rumors-lebron-james-damian-lillard">Blazers Edge</a>)</p>
											<p>Lillard makes a great point. There were other reports this week that Irving envied the role that Lillard and John Wall has. While Lillard and Wall are both the best player on their respective teams, this is a very interesting take if the reports are true. In my opinion, players like Wall and Lillard probably envy the position Irving is in. Irving’s desire may truly be to be the best player, and the leader of his team. While that desire is understandable, it becomes less understandable when you factor in winning. Would Irving really compromise playing for a championship every season to be the face of a franchise that will likely lose in the second round of the playoffs each year?</p>
											<p>The part I find flawed in Irving’s wishful thinking is that he may have himself overrated. Every player should be confident in his own abilities on the floor, especially someone of Irving’s status. However, the reason Irving thrives in Cleveland is because he is a flat-out scorer, one of the best in the league, in fact. Playing alongside Lebron James allows James to facilitate the offense, and Irving to simply focus on getting buckets. James needs Irving to be the ridiculous scorer that he is for this Cavs team to succeed. Irving may be misled by his own thoughts because typically a player like Irving doesn’t breed success for a team when he is their best player. For example, over the last three seasons, the Cavs are 4-23 when Lebron James isn’t playing. Now, the Cavs may have also been without Irving for some of those games, but certainly not all or most of them. This record does not exactly support the notion that Irving can lead a team. </p>
											<p>In Cleveland, Irving gets to compete for a championship every year, play alongside the best player in the world, is never defended by the other team’s best defender, and gets to take more shots than Lebron James. It is very hard to find a better situation than that.</p>
											<h2>Why Should Kyrie Want to Leave?</h2>
											<p>So much of this story has emphasized two rumored factors. One is that Irving wants to be the best player on his team, and the other is that his relationship with Lebron James has been damaged. </p>
											<p>It truly is sad that we may have seen the last of Irving and James playing as a duo; the two complemented each other well. However, I don’t this as the result of a deteriorating relationship between the two. Sure, these trade rumors have certainly weakened this relationship. However, I think the purpose behind these trade rumors are more self-centered for Irving. I believe Irving is requesting a trade because he is planning for the future a year early. Let’s take a look at everything that has happened to the Cavs since the month of June.</p>
											<p>
												<ul>
													<li>The Cavs lost to the Warriors in five games in the NBA Finals</li>
													<li>The Cavs let David Griffin go as their General Manager</li>
													<li>The Cavs fail to complete trades for both Paul George and Jimmy Butler</li>
													<li>The Cavs attempt signing Chauncey Billups as GM, until he withdraws his name from consideration</li>
													<li>Reports indicate that Lebron is frustrated with the Cavs offseason.</li>
												</ul>
											</p>
											<p>That is a lot of disappointment if you are Kyrie Irving. This team was beaten badly by the Warriors in the Finals, and without the Cavs improving the team this offseason, Irving may be wanting a way out before inevitably falling to the Warriors once again. Irving was also, reportedly, a big fan of former GM David Griffin, so losing him certainly factors in. Then, there are the rumors of Lebron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers next offseason. I believe these reports could be very accurate, and Irving may know more than we do. If he has any belief that James will be gone after this season, he may be aiming to leave before he himself is left in Cleveland.</p>
											<p>Now you may be asking, “Isn’t that what he wants? To be the best player on the team?” However, without James, this Cavaliers team is a very underwhelming team. Irving may indeed want to be the best player on his team, but I am sure he does still want to play for a winning basketball team. Requesting a trade for a team that has better talent on it, that will allow him to become the best player on the team, is the move that I believe Irving is looking for here. </p>
											<h2>Where Will Kyrie LAnd?</h2>
											<p>The teams that have been rumored as possible landing spots for Irving include the Spurs, Knicks, Heat, Timberwolves, Suns, Clippers, and Nuggets. </p>
											<p>While the Spurs and Timberwolves would provide the best scenario for Irving to win, it is debatable as to if he would be the best player on either team. He certainly would be playing second-fiddle for the Spurs alongside Kawhi Leonard, and would possibly do the same with Jimmy Butler for the Timberwolves.</p>
											<p>More recent rumors have indicated that Irving would prefer to play for the Knicks. This may sound like a surprising choice, but it does provide plenty of upside. The Knicks have a new GM, and no longer have the cloud of Phil Jackson hanging over them. The Knicks will likely trade Carmelo Anthony soon, and pair Irving up with rising star Kristaps Porzingis. To add to this list of incentives, Irving grew up in New Jersey, so this would allow him to play close to home. As crazy as it may seem, we may be seeing Irving in a New York Knicks jersey very soon.</p>
											<p>A new chapter is beginning for Irving, as a championship duo may soon be broken in Cleveland.</p>
