										<p>Controversy causes division; athletes kneeling during the playing of the national anthem has caused more division than progress. </p>
										<p>“I don’t have a problem with people protesting and having their voice heard, but there are ways to protest,” said Pete Garner, a U.S. Army and Air Force veteran. “There are constructive and productive ways to protest. I think that’s an inappropriate way to take a stand.” </p>
										<p>This quote came in response to the National Anthem protests coming from famous athletes across the nation. Initiated by San Francisco 49ers’ quarterback Colin Kaepernick, he knelt to show support of black people and all people of color who are being oppressed in this nation. His teammate, Eric Reid, followed, as did several other NFL players. Athletes in other sports followed the lead that some NFL players took. This included Megan Rapinoe, who knelt before a National Women’s Soccer League match, according to <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2016/9/11/12869726/colin-kaepernick-national-anthem-protest-seahawks-brandon-marshall-nfl">SB Nation.</a></p>
										<p>In the leagues where protests have occurred, there is no rule requiring athletes to stand during the playing of the national anthem.</p>
										<p>“In a national spotlight, like pro athletes are in, I don’t think it’s appropriate,” Garner said. “It’s a tough one because there’s nothing saying that you have to.”</p>
										<p>This piece was not written to argue that players should not have the right to kneel. These players have First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and should be able to use their platform to voice their opinions. </p>
										<p>The general cause for these athletes kneeling has been to show support for oppressed people of color in this nation. This article will in no way devalue this cause, as it is without a doubt a worthy one. However, progress should lead to more unity, not more division.</p>
										<p>These protests bring awareness to this issue. Kaepernick sparked a national debate across sports and news sources everywhere when he was initially spotted sitting during the playing of the national anthem. Before this protest, racial oppression was certainly a topic of discussion, but it wasn’t receiving the same amount of attention as it was after the protests began. While it is difficult to know Kaepernick’s true intentions in starting this protest, many people across the news spectrum believe he wanted to raise awareness for this issue. He achieved that goal not only through the rapid increase of important racial discussions, but also through protests by other athletes who followed Kaepernick’s lead.</p>
										<p>Some assume that the majority of those who are serving and who have served in our military would oppose the stance that Kaepernick and others are taking, but, according to CNN, several have voiced their support for Kaepernick over social media using the hashtag #VeteransForKaepernick. Many veterans using this hashtag mentioned in their posts that they served their nation to protect the right to free speech which includes the free speech of Kaepernick and other athletes choosing not to stand.</p>
										<p>While all of the elements to this argument hold true, several issues remain with choosing to protest in this way.</p>
										<p>“I guess it just makes me sad more than anything,” said Morgan Mays, a former women’s soccer player at Marshall University. “Many of these athletes are role models to people. It’s sad that we can’t come together and respect the people that are defending our country.”</p>
										<p>This article opened by stating that controversy leads to division. While athletes not standing for the playing of the national anthem have the right to do so, this protest may not help create progress. Countless articles have already been written discussing this topic, and journalists across numerous news platforms have lined up on both sides of the argument. The majority of these arguments assert that the cause for this protest is a worthy one and that the racial oppression in this country needs a solution. However, the fact that people are debating whether athletes should or should not stand for the national anthem proves that there is less attention being given to the original issue. While this act of protest has certainly brought about a race conversation, the majority of discussions concerning this issue have revolved around the issue of protesting the national anthem. While this is an important debate to have, it’s not the intended conversation. Too many people merely having discussions, rather than looking for solutions.</p>
										<p>While Kaepernick has received some support from veterans, he has received just as much, if not more, backlash from veterans. Those who serve in our military do not serve our flag or the singing of our national anthem. However, many of these people view the playing of the national anthem as a time to recognize their service and to show them gratitude for putting their lives on the line for this nation. In several football stadiums, a giant American flag is often stretched across the field for the playing of the national anthem; the people holding the flag are typically veterans. It’s understandable why veterans who dedicate so much of their lives to serving our country would take offense to these protests.</p>
										<p>With this being said, alternate ways to promote this cause of fighting oppression that do not create controversy exist. An example of this comes from another player who has knelt during the playing of the national anthem. Earlier this year, Denver Broncos’ linebacker Brandon Marshall met with Denver Police Chief Robert White to discuss race relations, according to the <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/09/13/broncos-brandon-marshall-meets-with-denver-police-chief-robert-white/"Denver Post></a>. This conversation lasted for about an hour, and the two discussed topics ranging from officer training to nationwide police brutality. However, Marshall’s work did not stop there. He will also participate in a ride-along, testing training simulations, and speaking with elementary schooners about making smart decisions. </p>
										<p>These should be the kinds of actions that professional athletes take an attempt to make their voices heard. When athletes take the time to work alongside people like police officers to better their community, true progress can be achieved.</p>
										<p>It is understandable why athletes are protesting to raise awareness to issues; however, more attention needs to be spent on the actual issues. These protests have offended those who have served our country and, therefore, created more division in a country that needs unity. </p>
