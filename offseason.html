											<p>The NBA offseason has been full of surprises thus far, as several of the league’s biggest stars have switched teams since the end of the 2016-2017 season.</p>
											<p>The NBA Draft gave fans hope of an offseason frenzy with the trade of Jimmy Butler to the Timberwolves, and heavy trade rumors regarding Paul George. The crop of free agents was also star-studded, with names like Chris Paul, Blake Griffin, and Gordon Hayward. With the Golden State Warriors looking primed for a dynasty, other teams in the league have set a new agenda—creating a super-team.</p>
											<p>The majority of the big-name free agents have already signed, and several other players have already been traded. Let’s look at the grades for each major offseason move since the NBA Draft.</p>
											<h2>Chris Paul Traded to the Houston Rockets</h2>
											<p>This trade was one of the first big moves made this offseason, and came as a surprise to much of the league. The Rockets had been linked to Chris Paul, but rumors were that they were interested in almost every big-name free agent this summer. It was hard to tell which rumors were true, and if they could clear the cap space necessary to land a superstar. In all honesty, out of everyone the Rockets could have acquired, Paul seemed like the least reasonable to me. I could have seen a forward, like Blake Griffin or Gordon Hayward, going to the Rockets before Paul. With Paul in Houston now, the Rockets essentially have two point guards. Paul will go down as one of the all-time great point guards to play in this league, and he is being matched with James Harden, who had an MVP-caliber season last year playing point guard. This team could very well work out. The Rockets averaged the second-highest points per game (PPG) last season, so adding someone like Paul, who can operate an offense like no other can certainly help. Paul will also add a strong defensive presence to this team, which is something the Rockets lack. The only concern is Paul and Harden co-existing. Each of these players play their best when they control the ball. One of these players, probably Harden, will need to learn how to score off the ball more efficiently for this team to reach its full potential. Despite these questions, the Rockets have given Harden an all-star to play alongside of, which is something he did not have last year. In this league, anytime you can gather multiple superstars on one team, it is a success. If Harden and Paul can co-exist, this move puts the Rockets one step closer to the Warriors.</p>
											<p>The Clippers weren’t expecting to be able to trade Paul. It was assumed that he would sign elsewhere after opting out of his contract. However, the Clippers pulling off a sign-and-trade is huge, because they were able to acquire pieces to build around as opposed to losing Paul for nothing.</p>
											<h3>Rockets’ Grade: B</h3>
											<h3>Clippers’ Grade: B</h3>
											<h2>Blake Griffin Re-Signs with the Los Angeles Clippers</h2>
											<p>The Clippers trading Chris Paul seemed like a sign of a Clippers’ rebuild. The Clippers did not receive any potential stars from Houston in the Paul trade. Also, there are rumors in the league, per<a href="http://deadspin.com/report-chris-paul-hated-austin-and-doc-rivers-1796493696"> Deadspin</a>, that one of the reasons Paul wanted out was because of nepotism from Head Coach Doc Rivers towards his son, Austin Rivers, who is still on the Clippers. Add in the fact that Blake Griffin was rumored to have been shopped by the Clippers in seasons’ past, there seemed little cause for Griffin re-signing with the Clippers. The likelihood of Griffin signing with a contender like Houston or Boston was increasing heavily. However, that is not what happened at all. This move makes perfect sense for Griffin. He is now the second-highest paid player in NBA history, and will continue to live in L.A. However, from the Clippers’ perspective, the move is mind-boggling. I think Griffin is a fantastic player, and would have contributed well to a championship-contending team. However, he has been plagued by injury throughout his career, and has not shown the ability to lead a team to the playoffs as the best player on his team. To say he is worth the $173 million contract he signed is ridiculous. Yes, players are getting paid more and more each year, and deservedly so. However, the Clippers paying Griffin that amount shows their lack of direction. They have almost no opportunity to add another superstar to this team amid the absence of Paul, and are overpaying a player who they have tried to trade several times before. The Clippers may have missed their window to restart as a franchise.</p>
											<h3>Grade: D</h3>
											<h2>The Oklahoma City Thunder Trade for Paul George</h2>
											<p>Thunder GM Sam Presti came out of nowhere to strike the deal sending Paul George to the Thunder. For Weeks, George trade rumors have centered around the Cavs, Celtics, Lakers, and Rockets. However, not once were the Thunder involved in these rumors. Yes, George has stated that he wants to sign long-term with the Lakers next season. However, this was a no-brainer for the Thunder. This is clearly a high-risk, high-reward kind of deal. Considering the Thunder only gave up Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis for George, and George’s contract was actually less than Oladipo’s, this trade is brilliant. There is the risk of George playing this year in OKC and leaving next year to go to L.A. However, if the Thunder can go further than the first-round in the playoffs with this team, and prove they are an elite team in the West, they may just convince George to stay. They may have to go out and sign another big-name free agent next summer, like Demarcus Cousins, but if it keeps George in OKC, it’s well worth it. I don’t think that the duo of Russell Westbrook and George right now is enough to compete for a championship, but it is enough to elevate the Thunder, and possibly make them an attractive team for other superstars to join. </p>
											<p>This trade may not have been what the Pacers were expecting. While Oladipo shows some promise, they could have potentially gotten a boat load of assets from someone like Boston that would have catapulted the Pacers’ rebuild. However, the Celtics have been very stubborn in trading their young, potential stars, so this may have been the best offer the Pacers had. Although disappointing, it allows this team to rebuild, and not at the cost of losing George for nothing.</p>
											<h3>Thunder Grade: A</h3>
											<h3>Pacers’ Grade: B-</h3>
											<h2>Steph Curry Re-Signs with the Golden State Warriors</p>
											<p>This was an expected re-signing, but the amount of money was not expected. This a historic move because it makes Curry the highest paid player in NBA history. The Warriors re-signed Curry for $201 million over five years. With teams getting more money to spend in free-agency each year, deals like Curry’s may become more frequent among the NBA’s best players. This deal is monumental for basketball players around the world, as the NBA is quickly becoming a very pro-player league. </p>
											<h3>Grade: A</h3>
											<h2>Ricky Rubio Traded to the Utah Jazz</h2>
											<p>The Timberwolves have been looking to unload Rubio for quite some time, and the Jazz were the team to finally make a deal happen. For the Timberwolves, this a solid move, as they were clearly looking to clear cap space to sign another point guard in this free agent class. For the Jazz, this move is interesting. Rubio has never lived up to the potential he had entering this league. He possesses great passing skills, but his shooting has never really developed. This move indicates that the Jazz will let go of George Hill as their point guard, who had a very good season and postseason for the Jazz. I’m not sure if this is the right move for the Jazz if they are trying to re-sign Gordon Hayward.</p>
											<h3>Timberwolves’ Grade: B+</h3>
											<h3>Jazz Grade: C</h3>
											<h2>The Minnesota Timberwolves Sign Jeff Teague</h2>
											<p>Immediately following the Rubio trade, the Timberwolves land Jeff Teague. Teague is a more accomplished point guard in this league than Rubio is. He is not a huge upgrade from Rubio, but he excels where Rubio failed, which is primarily in shooting, something this Timberwolves team lacks. Teague may not be able to see the floor the way Rubio does, but that may be advantageous to the Timberwolves, who will want their biggest stars (Butler, Wiggins and Towns) to handle the ball.</p>
											<h3>Grade: B</h3>
											<h2>The Denver Nuggets Sign Paul Millsap</h2>
											<p>The Nuggets have been in hot pursuit of a superstar for quite some time. However, the team missed out on many of the available superstars this offseason. While this may come as a disappointment to some, it is not necessarily a bad thing. Although Millsap may not be a superstar, he is still a former all-star, and brings a strong post-presence to the Nuggets. His presence will be beneficial to a young Nuggets team, and may accelerate their development into a Western Conference contender. I believe the Nuggets will be a playoff team this year with Millsap on their roster.</p>
											<h3>Grade: A-</h3>
											<h2>Kyle Lowry Re-Signs with the Toronto Raptors</h2>
											<p>There were rumors early in the offseason of Lowry possibly signing with a team like Minnesota or Denver. However, it makes sense for Lowry to re-sign with Toronto. There weren’t many realistic options other than Toronto with there being so many talented point guards in this league. Signing Lowry keeps the Raptors among the best in a weak Eastern Conference, but it doesn’t make this team any better than they were last year.</p>
											<h3>Grade: B-</h3>
											<h2>Kevin Durant Re-Signs with the Golden State Warriors</h2>
											<p> This is another expected move for the Warriors, but interesting nonetheless. The deal is for two years, and for $53 million. Durant is making around $9 million less than a max deal to stay on this team. This perfect for the Warriors, and shows that Durant is dedicated to winning more rings in Golden State. It will be interesting to see how many more championships the team has won in two years, and if it’s enough to make Durant to stay longer.</p>
											<h3>Grade: A</h3>
											<h2>Gordon Hayward Prediction</h2>
											<p>	The Gordon Hayward sweepstakes have become a three-team race between the Jazz, Celtics and Heat. It seems likely that Hayward will leave the Jazz for either Boston or Miami. The Western Conference is suddenly loaded with talent, and it would be easier to win in Boston or Miami in the weaker Eastern Conference. While many believe Hayward will end up in Boston, I tend to disagree. While the Celtics may have the best roster out of these three teams, Hayward doesn’t make the Celtics better than the Cavs in the East. The Celtics have shown an extreme inability to sign or trade for other superstars, so Hayward may be reluctant to sign with a team that may not be a contender for another three seasons. The Heat don’t have a talented roster by any means; however, Pat Riley has shown the ability to attract superstars to Miami in the past. If the Heat can sell Hayward on their intention to bring another superstar to Miami, Hayward may just sign with the Heat.</p>
											<h3>My Prediction: Hayward signs with the Heat.</h3>
											<p>These deals mentioned have completely re-shaped the league, as most of the talent lies in the Western Conference. The Eastern Conference now has more teams rebuilding than competing for a playoff spot. There are still big names left unsigned, like Gordon Hayward, and there is still a possibility of a Carmelo Anthony trade. Each of these players could be added to a playoff contender in the coming days. The NBA is very different today than it was several weeks ago.</p>
